#### Since I have been in the IT field, I have noticed time and time again just how overlooked information security can be. I have always had the desire to have a career that takes my skills and applies it to the betterment of the organization and it's users. My undying need to play the "protector" role is what led me to pursue this career path in the first place. It's a scary world out there and technology is evolving exponentially year after year. The fact that I can play a part in defending real people in a digital world is what excites me to continue mastering my craft in the field of cybersecurity.
